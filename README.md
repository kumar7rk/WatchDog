The project was developed for care givers in residential care homes. Passive RFID tags are attachned to the cloths of patients and RFID antennas are placed at various corners around the house. Whenever a patient escapes their authorised boundary, a notification is sent on the android application with the details such as current location, path trajectory etc. of the escaped person.

This project carried as a group project including Alex, Young, Jude and I. I was responsible for the android application. The app layout was built using Navigation Drawer design pattern. The notification mechanism was built using XMPP. 
Notable feature of the app:
* Ability to add and edit patient information
* Reset authorised boundaries
* Real-time notification on unauthorised wandering-off
* Floor plan
* Track Patient's path on escapement
